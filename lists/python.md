# My python reading list

This list contains things I have read about python that
I found to be vaguely useful.


## [Why Python 3 exists](https://snarky.ca/why-python-3-exists/)

TLDR: it's unicode. 

## [How to write unmaintainable code](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02161/2018/files/how_to_write_unmaintainable_code.pdf)

Absolutely essential reading (with tongue firmly in cheek) 
for those who want to write code that will make them
unfireable.

## [The Grand Unified Theory of Software Architecture](https://danuker.go.ro/the-grand-unified-theory-of-software-architecture.html)

Describes the "clean architecture" for separating interfaces, and core logic. 


## [Comprehensive Python Cheatsheet](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/)

A useful reference to come back to


## [Beartype docs](https://beartype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The documentation for beartype is...wild. 
It's certainly not for everyone but I love it. 
It's detailed, informative, and so much **fun** to read.

## [Python Magic Methods You Haven't Heard About](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/87)

When I read this the first time I certainly learnt a thing or two. 


## [Brandon Rhodes' PyCon Pandas tutorial](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial)

Like almost anything from Brandon Rhodes, this is great.

## [Python Design Patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/)

An absolutely useful reference for design patterns in python by Brandon Rhodes. 


## [Modern Polars](https://kevinheavey.github.io/modern-polars/)

An introduction to Polars and a comparison with Pandas. 
I've never liked Pandas and always found it confusing and un-intuitive. 


## [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

Uncle Bob's clean architecture<sup>™️</sup>. 


## [Making lunch faster with Python concurrency](https://sourcery.ai/blog/concurrency/)

A somewhat useful introduction to concurrency in python. 


## [Learn by reading code: Python standard library design decisions explained](https://death.andgravity.com/stdlib)

Someone who advocates for reading python's standard library to understand it. 


## [Python Concurrency From the Ground Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4)

There are currently three popular approaches to Python concurrency: threads, event loops, and coroutines. Each is shrouded by various degrees of mystery and peril.  In this talk, all three approaches will be deconstructed and explained in a epic ground-up live coding battle

## [Python Has a Startup File!](https://www.assertnotmagic.com/2018/06/30/python-startup-file/)

I didn't know about any of this when I read it.
