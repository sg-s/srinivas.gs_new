# My YouTube Media diet

I watch a fair bit of content on YouTube. This list 
is a semi-random, non-ordered collection of channels I
watch, with some notes about each. 


## [ 3Blue1Brown ](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)

Watching a 3Blue1Brown video is like reading GEB -- it 
feels like someone is injecting something sublime directly
into your brain and you can glimpse at beauty you could
never imagine every now and then.
