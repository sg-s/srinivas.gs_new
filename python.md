# My python reading list

This list contains things I have read about python that
I found to be vaguely useful.


## [Why Python 3 exists](https://snarky.ca/why-python-3-exists/)

TLDR: it's unicode. 

## [How to write unmaintainable code](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02161/2018/files/how_to_write_unmaintainable_code.pdf)

Absolutely essential reading (with tongue firmly in cheek) 
for those who want to write code that will make them
unfireable.


## [The Grand Unified Theory of Software Architecture](https://danuker.go.ro/the-grand-unified-theory-of-software-architecture.html)

Describes the "clean architecture" for separating interfaces, and core logic.
